# Mobile Driving License (mDL) Applets

This directory contains an implementation of the mDL specification (ISO
18013-5: Mobile driving licence (mDL) application specifications). These
applets are JavaCard 3.0.5 compliant and executes in a secure element.

# Supported Features

- NDEF Tag Applet: Supports mDL Device Engagement using NFC T4T protocols.
- Presentation Applet: Supports presentation of an mDL to a compliant card
  reader.
- Provisioning Applet: Supports Direct Access mDL credential provisioning on a
  secure Element, as defined by the identity credential component/framework in
  https://github.com/openwallet-foundation-labs/identity-credential.

# Unsupported features

- These applets do not support non-NFC mDL presentation.
- These applets do not provide an NFC-based provisioning interface;
  provisioning must be done from the host device.

# Design Notes

## NDEF Tag Applet:

- This applet implements ISO 18013-5 section 8.2.2.1, "Device Engagement using
  NFC", which uses T4T protocols.
- As part of this functionality, the applet returns the capabilities container
  and mDL-specific NDEF File to the reader.
- The returned NDEF File is generated by the Presentation Applet, which the
  NDEF Tag Applet gets through the MdlService Shareable interface.

## Presentation Applet:

- This applet implements ISO 18013-5 section 8.3, "Device Retrieval" and
  section 9.1 "Security Mechanisms".
- It supports Provisioning through the MdlPresentationPkgStore shareable
  interface.
- It supports device engagement through the MdlService shareable interface,
  where it returns the NDEF file needed by the NDEF Tag Applet. This file
  contains static data and a dynamically-generated ephemeral EC public key.

## Provisioning Applet:

- This applet supports provisioning of the directly accessible credential
  data.
- Unlike the NDEF Tag Applet and the Presentation Applet, which are executed
  when the NFC reader discovers the secure element as a type 4 tag, this
  applet is used when an identity credential application on the host device
  provisions credential data for direct access by an NFC reader.
- An Android identity credential application provisions mDL data for direct
  access through the OMAPI subsystem and this applet.
- This applet uses the MdlPresentationPkgStore shareable interface to store
  data in the Presentation Applet.
